    "        - Lazy Loading / Cache-Aside / Lazy Population\n",
    "            * Pros:\n",
    "                    1. Only requested data is cached (cache doesn't have unused data)\n",
    "                    2. Node failovers are not fatal\n",
    "            * Cons:\n",
    "                    1. Cache miss penalty that results in 3 round trips\n",
    "                    2. Stale data: Data can be updated in the database but outdated in the cache\n",
    "        - Write Though: Add or update cache when database is updated\n",
    "            * Pros:\n",
    "                    1. Data in cache is never stale\n",
    "                    2. Write penalty requires 2 calls as compared to 3 calls for cache miss penalty in Lazy loading\n",

    "            * Cons:\n",
    "                    1. Missing data until it's added/updated in the cache\n",
    "                    2. A lot of data in the cache may not be read\n",

    "    * Cache Evictions and Time-to-live (TTL)\n",
    "            * Cache eviction can occur in three ways:\n",
    "                    1. You delete the item explicitly from the cache\n",
    "                    2. Item is evicted because the memory is full and it's "
