    "A query operation finds items in your table based on the primary key attribute, and a distinct value to search for. A query can be refined by using an optional sort key name and value. By default a query returns all the attributes. You can limit the attributes to the specific attributes you want by using the `ProjectionExpression` parameter.\n",
